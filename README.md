# AV_GOT_DeepLearning
AV datahack on deep learning CV 

The repo includes most models tried on AV Computer vision hackathon. Pointers:

1. Fastai significantly out performs pure pytorch based models
2. Around 30 different models were tried mainly from Cadene's pretrained repo, DenseNet, SENET, polynet,Inception variations,ResNets, Resnets with BAM, and some variations of pretrained EfficientNet
3. Public LB: 17th Private LB: ??
